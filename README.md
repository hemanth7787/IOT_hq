# Flask-IOT-map

A python(flask) IOT server implementation.

#### Tech

This application uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Flask] - a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions
* [Peewee] - Peewee is a simple and small ORM. It has few (but expressive) concepts

#### Setup:

```sh
# As on ubuntu 14.04
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
